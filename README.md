# ‚öΩ Strikers Performance Analysis

This project focuses on **comprehensive analysis, modeling, and clustering of football strikers‚Äô performance data**.  
The goal is to **understand performance patterns, classify strikers based on key attributes, and predict future performance types** using statistical and machine learning techniques.  

It combines **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical hypothesis testing, clustering, and supervised learning** to deliver actionable insights.

## üìä Features of the Project

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
Before any analysis, the raw dataset undergoes **cleaning and preparation**:
- **Missing Value Imputation:**  
  - For numerical features ‚Üí Imputed using **median** strategy.  
  - For categorical features ‚Üí Imputed using **most frequent** strategy.  
- **Data Type Correction:**  
  - Specific columns like 'Goals Scored', 'Assists', 'Shots on Target', etc., are converted to integer types for accurate processing.

---

### 2. **Descriptive Analysis**
Statistical summaries and visualization are used to understand the dataset:
- **Descriptive Statistics:**  
  - Mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, etc., rounded to 2 decimal places.
- **Pie Chart:**  
  - Shows the percentage distribution of players‚Äô **footedness**.
- **Countplot:**  
  - Displays distribution of footedness across different nationalities.

---

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**
To extract deeper insights, several statistical methods are applied:
- **Top Scoring Nationality:**  
  - Identifies which nationality produces strikers with the highest average goals scored.
- **Average Conversion Rate by Footedness:**  
  - Compares finishing efficiency between left-footed and right-footed players.
- **ANOVA Test:**  
  - Checks whether **consistency rates** significantly differ among strikers from different nationalities.
- **Correlation Test:**  
  - Evaluates if **Hold-up Play** is significantly correlated with **Consistency**.
- **Regression Analysis:**  
  - Assesses if Hold-up Play significantly influences Consistency.

---

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
Enhancements are made to create new useful features:
- **Total Contribution Score:**  
  - Sum of performance metrics like Goals, Assists, Shots, Dribbling, Aerial Duels, Defensive Contribution, Big Game Performance, and Consistency.
- **Label Encoding:**  
  - Encodes categorical variables such as **Footedness** and **Marital Status**.
- **Dummy Variables:**  
  - Converts **Nationality** into one-hot encoded features.

---

### 5. **Clustering Analysis**
Groups strikers into performance-based segments:
- **KMeans Clustering:**  
  - Uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (**2** in this case).
- **Cluster Tagging:**  
  - Cluster 0 ‚Üí **Best Strikers** üèÜ  
  - Cluster 1 ‚Üí **Regular Strikers** ‚öΩ
- **Feature Mapping:**  
  - Creates a 'Strikers types' column using mapping for easy classification.

---

### 6. **Machine Learning**
Builds a classification model to predict striker type:
- **Data Preparation:**
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
  - Train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)
- **Model:**
  - Logistic Regression for classification.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy score (%)  
  - Confusion matrix (visualized with heatmap)
